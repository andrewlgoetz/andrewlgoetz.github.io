        <p style="width: 90%; text-align:left; padding-left:30px; line-height: 1.5;"> &emsp; I am a student at McMaster University, where I am completing my B.A.Sc. Honours, Computer Science degree. 
          I am expected to graduate in 2025 and have been honoured with the Dean's List on two occasions (active), and am proud to have a GPA of 3.9. I am also the recipient of the 2021 McMaster Engineering Achievement Award. 
          My coursework has included Data Structures and Algorithms, Software Development, Algorithm Design, Databases, and Logical Reasoning. <br> <br>

          &emsp;In high school I have achieved a 4.0 GPA, and was included on the honour roll four times. I was also active in extracurricular activities,
           such as the Debate Team, Basketball Team, and DECA. This experience has provided me with the ability to work well in teams and communicate effectively. These experiences and education have allowed 
           me to develop strong problem-solving, critical thinking, and technical skills that I can apply to a wide range of professional settings.</p>

              <td style="line-height: 1.5;">
                &emsp; As part of a technical support team in a hospital setting, I was responsible for troubleshooting software and hardware issues for hospital staff. I have learned about many technologies such as Active Directory:
               including creating and managing user accounts, groups, and permissions, as well as troubleshooting and resolving issues related to authentication and authorization. Additionally Microsoft Citrix, which is a software 
               that enables remote access to applications and desktops. I was responsible for installing, configuring, and maintaining Citrix clients, and troubleshooting and resolving issues related to remote access and performance. 
               I also helped the hospital staff and patients to understand how to use Citrix and how to access their applications and desktops remotely. Additionally, I was responsible for device imaging and driver and other software 
               installations, updates, and repairs on hospital computers and biomedical devices. 
                I was entrusted with confidential information and had remote access to hospital computers. Through my efforts, I successfully corrected software and hardware tickets and end-user errors.
                  <br><br> 
                  &emsp; In addition to my technical responsibilities, I also excelled in communicating with hospital staff, patients, vendors, and clients. I was able to handle interactions in person, over the phone, and through written communication. 
                  interacting with both technical and non-technical staff.
                  I was able to establish positive relationships with all stakeholders, and was able to effectively explain technical issues and solutions to non-technical individuals. 
                  I was able to prioritize and manage multiple tasks and projects simultaneously and I was able to communicate effectively with all members of the team, ensuring that everyone was aware of the status of the projects. 
                  I also met with end-users virtually and in-person and wrote documentation/standard operating procedures for software use. Lastly, 
                  I assigned duties and tickets to IT personnel and teams.

              <td style="line-height: 1.5;"> &emsp; I have gained valuable experience through multiple positions held with the City of Hamilton that have honed my abilities as an independent problem-solver. 
                In this role, I was responsible for independently counting, recording, and depositing cash on a daily basis, utilizing the Office 365 suite to perform these functions.
                 Additionally, I was responsible for safeguarding sensitive information such as safe combinations and office keys, and I am proud to say that there were no errors or reports of missing funds 
                 despite handling over $60,000 total. I also had the opportunity to help execute public events, and maintain an hourly schedule. I also gained experience in customer service, by working in the recreation office, 
                 where I handled customer complaints and worked at the information desk. Additionally, I was responsible for maintaining the overall condition of the arena. Including assisting in Ice re-surfacing, and
                 performing routine facility inspections. I was also responsible for enforcing safety rules and regulations, and was the point of contact for any issues or concerns that arose during events or rentals.
                 I also helped to ensure that the arena & concession stand were in compliance with all local and provincial health & safety regulations, which required both CPR-C and provincial Food Handlers Certifications.
                 This role required a high level of attention to detail, as well as the ability to work independently and manage multiple tasks simultaneously.
                 Lastly, at this time, I was also volunteering with the City of Hamilton's Snow Angels, a snow removal service for seniors and individuals with disabilities.
